# RegressionModels

In this project, we will work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).  

We will examine the mtcars data set and explore how miles per gallon (MPG) is affected by different variables. In particularly, we will answer the following two questions: 
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG; and
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.
